### Open Community Runtime (OCR)

HCLIB is a library layer built on top of existing runtimes. This distribution 
contains an implementation of HCLIB built on top of the Open Community Runtime 
that must be installed separetely. Be careful to build OCR with ELS support 
enabled for one slot.

OCR is available from <https://01.org/projects/open-community-runtime>

You need to clone the OCR repository and get to the hclib branch:

git clone https://github.com/01org/ocr.git
cd ocr
git branch ocr-hclib --track origin/ocr-hclib
git checkout ocr-hclib

After installing OCR, you need to set the `OCR_ROOT` environment variable and
update your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as follow:

    export OCR_ROOT=/path/to/ocr/install
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${OCR_ROOT}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# Install Instructions

HCLIB relies on autotools as a build system. You can either invoke `configure` 
and `make` directly if familiar with, or use the provided installation script. 
Note that the installation script runs the whole tool chain and is overkill 
to recompile the library when updating code.

## Installation

Run the provided installation script:
    
    ./install.sh

By default, HCLIB is installed in the current folder, under `hclib_install/`

Defining the `HCLIB_ROOT` environment variable and updating the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` 
is optional but comes handy when writing compiler command lines.

    export HCLIB_ROOT=/path/to/hclib_install
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HCLIB_ROOT}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

You're done ! Check the `README` file for more information on using HCLIB
