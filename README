# HCLIB Overview

HCLIB is a library version of the Habanero-C language. This distribution contains an implementation of HCLIB built on top of the Open Community Runtime (OCR).

# Getting Started

## Installation

See the `INSTALL` file for detailed installation instructions.

## Running HCLIB non-regression tests

    cd tests;
    ./runTests

# Writing programs using HCLIB

HCLIB defines a C-based interface in the `hclib.h` header file. 
Just use the include directive in your program to import the interface:

    #include "hclib.h"

# Linking with HCLIB

If you have set the `HCLIB_ROOT` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable as described in the `INSTALL` file, the command line should look like the following:

    gcc -g -locr -lhclib -I${HCLIB_ROOT}/include your_program.c
