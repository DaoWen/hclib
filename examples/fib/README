This example demonstrates how the default configuration for ocrInformLegacyCodeB
locking can easily lead to deadlock. This example (recursive Fibonacci) will usu
ally deadlock when run with the default configuration (8 workers) for Fib(5). To
 build and run the example for Fib(5), simply "make run". You can change the Fib
onacci number by setting the WORKLOAD_ARGS environment variable.

To fix this issue, the following option needs to be enabled when building OCR:
ENABLE_SCHEDULER_BLOCKING_SUPPORT
