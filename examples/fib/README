This example demonstrates how the (busy-waiting) implementation of 
ocrLegacyBlockProgress can easily lead to deadlock. This example (recursive 
Fibonacci) will usually deadlock when run with the default configuration (8 
workers) for Fib(5). To build and run the example for Fib(5), simply "make 
run". You can change the Fibonacci number by setting the WORKLOAD_ARGS 
environment variable.
